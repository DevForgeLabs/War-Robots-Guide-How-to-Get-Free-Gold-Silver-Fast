### What Are Gold & Silver in War Robots?

Before diving into the methods of earning free Gold and Silver, letâ€™s first understand their importance in *War Robots*.

- **Gold**: This is the premium currency in the game. You can use Gold to purchase special items, buy premium robots, and speed up the upgrade process. Gold is usually harder to earn and often requires players to spend real money. However, there are several ways to accumulate Gold for free.
  
- **Silver**: This is the regular currency in *War Robots* and is used for upgrading robots and weapons. Silver is much easier to obtain than Gold, but it is still crucial to your progress. Unlike Gold, Silver is less restrictive, but that doesnâ€™t mean you should ignore the ways to maximize your earnings.

This option is great for players who donâ€™t mind spending a few seconds of their time watching an ad in exchange for valuable rewards.
